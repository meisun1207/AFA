AFA: Adversarial Frequency Alignment for Domain Generalized Lung Nodule Detection                                                                                                    
We released dataset list of LUNA we used in this paper.
Data
  We divided the CT scans into different domains according to their reconstructing convolution kernels. We selected the domains with fewer CT scans as target domains and the other domains were regarded as source domains.
